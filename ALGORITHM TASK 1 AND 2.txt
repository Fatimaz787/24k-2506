OBJECTIVE 3: ALGORITHM
TASK 1: IMPLEMENT AN ALGORITHM FOR DETERMINING IF AN Nth IS A DIVISOR 
OF AN NUMBER IF SO, DETERMINE IF IT IS EVEN NUMBER OR ODD NUMBER AS 
WELL
1) ASK THE USER TO ENTER DIVISOR
2) SET ANSWER TO MODULUS 2
3) IF ANSWER = 0 THEN
4) DISPLAY THE DIVISOR IS AN EVEN NUMBER 
5) ELSE DISPLAY THE DIVISOR IS AN ODD NUMBER 

TASK3: IMPLEMENT AN ALGORITHM FOR MAKING A SIMPLE CALCULATOR 
WITH ALL THE OPERATORS (+, -, *, \, %)
1)ASK THE USER TO ENTER 2 NUMBERS
2)INPUT NUM1 AND INPUT NUM2
3)ASK THE USER TO ENTER OPERATOR (+, -, *, \, %)
4)IF THE USER PUTS ‘+’ AS AN OPERATOR 
5)SUM IS EQUAL TO NUM1 + NUM2
6) DISPLAY SUM
7) ELSE IF THE USER ENTERS ‘- ‘AS AN OPERATOR
8)SUB IS EQUAL TO NUM1 – NUM2
9) DISPLAY SUB
10) ELSE IF THE USER ENTERS ‘*’ AS AN OPERATOR 
11) PRODUCT IS EQUAL TO NUM1 * NUM2
12)DISPLAY PRODUCT
13) ELSE IF THE USER ENTER ‘/’ AS AN OPERATOR
14) ANSWER IS EQUAL TO NUM1 / NUM2 
15) DISPLAY ANSWER 
16) ELSE THE USER ENTER ‘%’ AS AN OPERATOR
17) ANSWER IS EQUAL TO NUM1 % NUM2 
18) DISPLAY ANSWER
